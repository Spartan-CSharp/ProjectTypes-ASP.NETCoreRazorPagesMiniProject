The homework from the Lesson 11, Mini Project - ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, of Module 7, Common Project Types, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to build a Razor Pages application with two pages. Create a page that takes in a person's info and another that takes in address info (no need to associate it).
